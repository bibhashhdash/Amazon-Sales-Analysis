### Project Overview

The Amazon Sales Analysis project is based on Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) in which our main objective is to analyze amazon sales data to gain actionable insights, identify trends, optimize business processes and personalize customer experiences. This will help in strategic decision making and also in enhancing the overall customer experience of Amazon.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary datasets used for this analysis is "Amazon Fashion Data.csv" containing detailed information about the different categories of products and "Amazon Sales Data.csv" containing the order details and related informations.

### Tools

- Power BI (Power Query Editor) - Data Transformation & Manipulation
- Power BI (Power Pivot & DAX) - Data Modelling & Data Analysis
- Power BI (Power View) - Data Visualization

### Data Transformation

In the data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data preparation
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Modelling

In this phase, we create a relationship between the two tables/files to extract the required information for an in-detail analysis. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer key questions among others like:

- Which cities and states have the highest sales?
- What is the trend in the total number of sales over time?
- How does the total revenue compare to the total number of orders? 

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The top cities with the highest sales are Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai. The states with the highest sales are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu.
2. The total sales revenue increases during the summer season with a noticeable peak during the month of May and gradually drops down during the last week of June.
3. The total revenue generally follows the trend of total orders, but there are some months where revenue increases more significantly due to highly priced products. 

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following steps to be taken:
- Focus on top performing cities and states.
- Investigate and analyze the factors leading to the significant drop in June 2022 and develop strategies to tackle it.
- Examine and boost inventory for top-performing product categories.
